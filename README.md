SCEngine
========

A 3D engine I am currently working on.

This is still a Work In Progress and will be fleshed/refined as I go.

How to build (requires CMake) :

Linux - Command Line

1. clone the repository

	'git clone https://github.com/Maurogik/SCEngine.git'

2. go to the SCEngine folder and run the following commands

	'mkdir build && cd build'

	'cmake ..'

	'make'

3. Run the executable

	'./playground'
