SCEngine
========

A 3D engine I am currently working on.

This is still a Work In Progress and will be fleshed/refined as I go.

How to build (with cmd line, tested on linux): 

1. clone the repository

	'git clone https://github.com/Maurogik/SCEngine.git'

2. go to the SCEngine folder and run the following commands

	'mkdir build'

	'cd build'

	'cmake .'

	'make'

3. Run the executable

	'./playground'
